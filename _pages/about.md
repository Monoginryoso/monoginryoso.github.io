I am an undergraduate student majoring in Biomedical Sciences with a passion for digital art. My work often focuses on themes related to biology and other scientific disciplines, featuring original characters as well as occasional fanart.

This website serves as a platform to showcase the concepts and creative processes behind my artwork.
