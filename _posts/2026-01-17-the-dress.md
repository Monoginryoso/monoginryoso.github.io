Inspired by [The dress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress): if the bright side of the blue and black dress matches the dark side of the white and gold dress, then under the same light source, when two people wearing corresponding dresses stand close together, their outfits can be depicted using only six colors.

I noticed that the outfit style in [this image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Wikipe-tan_wearing_The_Dress_reduced.svg/2560px-Wikipe-tan_wearing_The_Dress_reduced.svg.png) is very similar to the maid dress of [Wikipe-tan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Wikipe-tan_full_length.svg/960px-Wikipe-tan_full_length.svg.png). Therefore, I imagined her lying on the mirror, while the mirror reflected a stranger version of her wearing a dress of opposite colors.

Also, happy 25th anniversary to Wikipedia! Wikipedia has passed me knowledge across various fields, though not always correct or objective, it brings endless fun, especially when daydreaming in lecture. ;)

### Process: 

* Idea
    - Considering my color usage habits, I lowered the saturation and contrast of these colors.

* Rough

* Further elaborate on the character located above, especially the shadows and the folds of the clothing
<br>

* Create a preliminary lineart to facilitate the subsequent coloring

* Basecolor

* Light and shadow
<br>

* Overlay the shadows drawn in the sketch onto the layer

* Rendering

* Lineart

* Adjust the shape of the folds

* Adding filters
