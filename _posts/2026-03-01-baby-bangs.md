Last month, I discovered a factory error Rei plush at the "落花盈裳" pop-up store in Shanghai Joy City Shopping Mall.

Her bangs resembled baby bangs, rather than the usual Rei plush with bangs centered in the middle. I wondered if her bangs were just curled up? However, after opening the packaging, I couldn't pull the fabric on her forehead down, it seemed to be glued.

This minor mistake actually made Rei look more suited to her neo-Chinese style outfit better.

* To create a vintage feel, many textured brushes were used, such as "Wet Glaze" to simulate the effect of watercolor blending.

* Writing calligraphy
    - It's so difficult to write Chinese characters and Kanji on iPad :(
