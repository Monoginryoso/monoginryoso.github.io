This is a mapped textured stereogram that needs to be viewed using parallel viewing.
<br><br>
The main character Amate "Machu" Yuzuriha from *Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX* gazes intently ahead in Kira-Kira. In other parallel universes, if Machu had not become a Gundam pilot, perhaps she would only witness the collapse of her own universe.
<br><br>
Kira-kira version:

### Process: 

* Idea
    - A mapped textured stereogram consisting of horizontally repeating patterns is very suitable for expressing the concept of parallel universes.
<br><br>
    Additionally, inspired by [the paper on the Oz vision system](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu1052), I believe that when the interactions of Minovsky particles focused on stimulating the M-cones of Newtypes, they would experience extremely vivid visual phenomena, such as the color "olo." However, this concept did not materialize in the final illustration.

* Depth map
    - Separates the light and shadows like cel shading, and highlights the kira-kira in front of Machu, however, due to the complexity of the depth map shape, the resulting stereogram is not effective.
<br>
![](/images/parallax_universe/parallax_universe_depth_map_1.png){:height="70%" width="70%"}

* Cel shading
    - Set the character part of the depth map to overlay mode to cover the base color.
<br>
![](/images/parallax_universe/parallax_universe_cel_shading.png){:height="70%" width="70%"}

* An improved depth map
    - Only retain the characters and soften the shadows to achieve a more natural effect.
<br>

* Rendering
    - Add a bit of transition on top of the cel shading and highlight the red accents on Machu's hair and uniform.
<br>
![](/images/parallax_universe/parallax_universe_render.png){:height="70%" width="70%"}

* Stereogram
    - Import the depth map and texture into the Stereogram Generator to create a mapped textured stereogram.
<br>
![](/images/parallax_universe/parallax_universe_stereogram_1.png){:height="70%" width="70%"}
<br><br>
    - Here are the parameters used for this illustration:
<br>
![](/images/parallax_universe/parallax_universe_stereogram_options.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}

* Modify the stereogram
    - Add Machu in kira-kira at the center of the stereogram, and use layer effects to diminish the other versions of Machu that are not in kira-kira.
<br>
![](/images/parallax_universe/parallax_universe_stereogram_1_render.png){:height="70%" width="70%"}

* Background
    - Use the air brush and the 'Snow Gum' brush to paint the background.
<br>
![](/images/parallax_universe/parallax_universe_background.png){:height="70%" width="70%"}

* Rendering the background
    - Use motion blur to soften the background, brighten the upper part of the image to highlight the character.
<br>
![](/images/parallax_universe/parallax_universe_background_render.png){:height="70%" width="70%"}

* Generate the final stereogram
<br>
![](/images/parallax_universe/parallax_universe_stereogram_2.png){:height="70%" width="70%"}

* Modify the final stereogram
<br>
![](/images/parallax_universe/parallax_universe_stereogram_2_render.png){:height="70%" width="70%"}

* Remove distortions
    - The mapped textured stereogram generated by this software produces distortions that show through the background, which are repaired with brushes.
