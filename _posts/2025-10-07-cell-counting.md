The grids of the counting chamber not only imprison cells but also time. Saturated desires gradually lose their osmotic pressure, tearing fissures in the ideal semipermeable membrane. Trypan blue gently seeps into these wounds, staining the transparent carcasses a deep, profound blue. No mourning is needed—only proof that existence once truly existed.

### Process: 

* Idea
    - Combining different elements based on the incomplete cell membranes of dead cells, the grid of the cell counting plate, the microscopic field of view, and the torn nitrile gloves.

* Enriching the colors of the image
    - Distinguished faces directly illuminated by the light source from those at angles away from it by altering hue/saturation.

* Rendering the character

* Adding filters
    - Simulated light attenuation effects and further enhanced the contrast of the image.
