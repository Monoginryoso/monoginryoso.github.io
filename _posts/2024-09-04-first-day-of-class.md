OC attended high school in a quiet, charming town.

### Process: 

* Idea
    - The character is on a sunny street. Warm colors are used as the main light source and cool colors as the secondary light source to emphasize the contrast between warm and cool colors.

* Rough
<br>
    ![](/images/first_day_of_class/first_day_of_class_rough.jpg){:height="70%" width="70%"}

* Color rough
    - The light illuminates the clothes, and their reflection appears on the face.

* Background
    - Since the background will be blurred later, it doesn't need to be drawn precisely. Add the necessary contours to define the shapes and features of the background.

* Gaussian blur
