I created a crossover fanart of Rei Ayanami from *Splatoon* × *Neon Genesis Evangelion*.
<br><br>
As both are life-sustaining liquids, the large areas of orange ink in *Splatoon* always remind me of the LCL from *Evangelion*. Therefore, I combined the scene of humanity returning to LCL form in *The End of Evangelion* with battle scenes from *Splatoon*, imagining inklings/octolings breaking free from their physical bodies.
<br><br>
The weapon that Rei holds is the Custom E-liter 4K from *Splatoon 3*. I designed a square script version of the NERV logo as the Custom logo, replacing the original single helix with a double helix that gradually narrows as the spear of Longinus.
<br><br>
Additionally, the Special weapon for the Custom E-liter 4K is the Kraken Royale. While using this special weapon, players transform into a giant squid/octopus, gaining a brief period of invincibility. Rei, who becomes gigantic after merging with Lilith, fits this concept perfectly. Representing her in octopus form further enhances the eerie feeling.

* Rendering the character
    - The highlights on the tentacles were intended to be painted with a reflection effect, like that on the surface of water, but it seems I couldn't quite achieve that.

* Sharpen 
    - I discovered that using rough brush strokes along with a sharpen effect makes it easier to highlight the metallic texture.
