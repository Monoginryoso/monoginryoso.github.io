It is that time of year again to deal with chocolate, and I am even dreaming of brushing my teeth with mint chocolate toothpaste.

This year, I discovered that mixing equal parts of white chocolate and dark chocolate tastes like a very sweet milk chocolate, but with a strange texture.

### Process: 

* Rough
    - Assigned white chocolate, 99% dark chocolate, and mint chocolate to three OCs.

* Lineart
    - One of the benefits of drawing chibi characters is that it allows for a more generalized representation of structure. So, I simplified the highlights in the character's hair and the folds in their clothes into heart shapes ♡.
    - Took a clearer structure image of the dopamine receptor D2 from the protein data bank and adjusted the colors to use as a background.

* Basecolor

* Rendering
    - For the shadows, I tried to use gray as much as possible, and added a lot of light blue and light purple to the highlights to keep the overall color scheme unified.

* Rendering the background
    - Once the character was completed, the background seemed too simple. Applied the same concept to render the background and sharpened the objects in the background using layer modes.
