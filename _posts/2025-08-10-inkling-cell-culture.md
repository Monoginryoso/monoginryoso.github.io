I drew my OC in the *Splatoon* universe, and as a result, my OC's job changed from cell culture to inkling culture.
<br><br>
Weapon concept: Since the weapons in *Splatoon* are based on real-world tools, I designed a modified splat charger for my OC based on micropipettes from biological laboratories. 
<br><br>
In the concept, the outer shell of this micropipette is an item left behind by human scientists from Alterna, and the volume range is represented in Alterna script, although this range no longer holds any practical significance. Its operation is similar to that of a water gun, and it can adjust the range and change the pipette tip just like a real-world micropipette.
<br><br>
The ink tank is modified from a closed cell culture bag used for culturing blood cells. In addition to storing ink for battles, it also features extendable EVA tubing that allows baby squids to drink ink.

### Process: 

* Rough

* Draft of the background and the baby squids

* Color rough
<br>

* Rendering
    - Adjust the weapon's structure, add the ink tank, and enhance the lighting.

* Lineart
<br>

* Rendering textures
    - Draw the tentacles as translucent and enhance the highlights. Add iridescence near the highlights that resembles the iridocytes of some real-world squids.

* Change the character's proportions

* Rendering the baby squids

* Gaussian blur
<br>

* Rendering the background
    - Changes the shape of the blood on the surgical drape as well as adding reflections on the metal (although it is not accurate).
