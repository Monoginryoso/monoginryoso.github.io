The inside of an extended-release tablet containing Methylphenidate HCl looks like neapolitan ice cream with three flavors.

### Process: 

* Brainstorming
    - Two compositions were prepared (front view and 3/4 view).
    <br>
    ![](/images/reuptake_inhibition/reuptake_inhibition_idea.jpg){:height="70%" width="70%"}

    - The latter was chosen because it is easier to draw other elements.
    <br>
    ![](/images/reuptake_inhibition/reuptake_inhibition_idea_final.jpg){:height="70%" width="70%"}


* Rough

    - Cleaned up the lines of the sketch and arranged the composition of the picture.

* Color rough
    - All elements, including the characters, drug overcoats and ice cream are in warm tones, so the shadows are in cooler colors.

* Further enrichment of color
    - Shadows become less bright, and complementary colors are added to the background margins and eyes. Determined the final effect of the artwork.
