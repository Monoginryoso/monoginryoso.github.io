Control the visual hierarchy by applying contrast of hue, contrast of value, and contrast of saturation to illustrate the messy cell culture waste from biomedical laboratories.

### Process: 

* Rough
    - The background is relatively cluttered, so the contrast and overall visual center needs to be controlled. Therefore, the visual of the finished artwork was first considered at the draft stage.
    - Contrast of hue: The visual center is a pink color and the background is a blue color, with a translucent pink cell culture medium as a transition between the visual center and the background. The blue latex gloves are placed on the pink area to create a strong contrast.
    - Contrast of value: the brightness of the visual center is higher, the brightness of the background is lower.
    - Contrast of saturation: the area near the visual center is more saturated, and the area far away from the visual center is less saturated.
    - Visual hierarchy guidance: Several pipette tips in the background point to the visual center (character) to guide the viewer's line of sight.

* Lineart
<br>
    - Adjustments to the structures which were not considered in the rough sketch.

* Rendering to the character
    - Changes were made to the color based on the sketch to match the structure of the lineart.

* Rendering the pipette tips
    - Also tracing the 6-well plate and the pipette tips that are not covered by it.

* Adding filters to further reduce the contrast and saturation of the background.
